Changelog for package qsr_prob_rep
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.3.0 (2016-01-20)
------------------
* Fixing normalisation of matrix. It only worked because they are square and all entries are 1.
* Printing debug information on creation of the pf for all models not only for the first two. Might have also killed the server if only one model.
* Adding all the new arguments of the hmm create message to the example hmm client. Use ... create -h for help.
* The assumption that every hmm has a start state 0 is not valid. now there is a flag `start_at_zero` when you want to enforce a start state at 0.
* generic hmm emi and trans have to numpy arrays to be consistent.
* Fixing available hmms for help message
* Adding simple tests for the particle filter
* Fixing install targets.
* Adding pybayes as a dependency
* Adding optional pseudo transitions to hmm.
* Adding a generic hmm that takes a lookup table, and optionally a transition and emission matrix. If the latter two are not provided, uniform distribution is assumed.
* Updating readme slightly
* Adding example files for particle filter creation.
* Adding helper functions and scripts to create all the files necessary for the particle filter from the HMM or for QTC
* Adding a particle filter for QRSs
* * Decoupling HMMs from the main library functionality to allow for other representations to be added more easily.
  * The Services are now create by decorating functions using the ServiceManager class.
  * Simplifies the service generation by not needing to maintain a dictionary with all the services.
  * Simplifies the class structure by not calling weird lambda functions anymore.
  * removing `qsr_type` from the service request and response.
  * Now part of the general kwargs for hmm
  * Particle filter will not use this
  * Allows to have a generic hmm that takes trans and emi matrix plus a lookup instead of a specific implementation.
* Renamed example ros client to example hmm client as every representation will have their own client.
* Introducing namespaces for services to distinguish between hmm and other representations.

  Also, updating README.
* Removing rubbish from test file.
* Updated documentation to reflect name changes.
* Cleaning up cmake and package file, adding qsr_prob_rep to meta package
* Adding tests for creation, sampling and loglikelihood of all three qtc types.
* Finally enabling qtcbc and minor changes
  * qtcbc now works using code from qtcb and qtcc and some custom functions overwriting the ones in qtc_hmm_abstractclass
  * Removed some prints and fixed comments.
* Fixing a bug where the final state was always 82... d'oh
* Renaming package
