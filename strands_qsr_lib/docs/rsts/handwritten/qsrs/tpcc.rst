Ternary Point Configuration Calculus
====================================

Description
-----------

*Ternary Point Configuration Calculus* (TPCC) deals with point-like objects in the 2D-plane. It is a application based variant of the Double Cross calculus, allowing finer distinctions of positional information than the calculi presented before.
