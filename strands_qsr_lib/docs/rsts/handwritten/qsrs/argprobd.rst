Probabilistic Qualitative Distance Calculus
===========================================

Description
-----------

*Probabilistic Qualitative Distance Calculus* (PQDC) relations define qualitative spatial distance relations between two objects according to the relations names and distance thresholds defined by the user, just like :doc:`Qualitative Distance Calculus <argd>`, with the difference that they are modelled as Gaussian distributions allowing overlap between the boundaries and fuzzy selection in the common areas.

Relations
---------

The relations are defined by the user-specified relations names and the corresponding distance thresholds.
